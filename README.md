# Laboratory-of-Data-Science
Bulding and population of a data warehouse using python code and Sql-Server Management Studio. SSIS data flows for querying by Visual Studio. Building an OLAP cube with SSAS, querying it by MDX.  Visual interactive representation of data by creation of a Microstrategy Dossier.

## Part 1
In [Part 1](https://github.com/alberts96/Laboratory-of-Data-Science/Part1) of the project we were required to create and populate a database starting from .csv
files and perform different operations on it. 

## Part 2
In [Part 2](https://github.com/alberts96/Laboratory-of-Data-Science/Part2) of the project we were required to answer some business questions on the database we  created in Part 1. We solved the exercises using Sequel Server Integration Services (SSIS)
with computation on client side (i.e., do not use any sql command, only standard SSIS
nodes). 

## Part 3
In [Part 3](https://github.com/alberts96/Laboratory-of-Data-Science/Part3) of the project we were required to answer some business questions on a datacube
that we created on the database we prepared. Then we solved the business questions using MultiDimensional eXpressions (MDX) in
SQL management studio.
